# Stories from dreams
## Writing practice towards my trilogy

I dream a lot. :)
The 'mondo onirico' brought me interesting and strange stories, some of them were quite articulate and I'm turning them in a book.

There's just a little detail, I'm not a former writer and English is not my mother tongue, so I need practice. 
Luckily the night is a never ending source of inspiration, and I have already a quite big backlog ready to be share (after some editing, don't try to read my soul!).

Enjoy the reading and be patient if you're waiting for the next (or the first) one.

Any feedback is welcome, be kind. 

It's possible I'll update some drawings here and there too...

It's time to recover this project!

## PART 1

“Oh, look, James! What’s that?” said Lucy looking at a peculiar bird. On a branch of a tree a little bird was eating a leaf, it had the pattern of a turtle on its wings. The two observers never saw something like that in their entire life.

James was very perplexed, he wanted to give an answer to her girlfriend, as this was his speciality and he brought her in the forest to show off, but he was astonished by that little wonderful creature. Quickly he let go his plan to show how intelligent and expert he was, and honestly said “Lucy, I wanted you to see me as a major expert in my field, knowing all the names and curiosity about the plants and animals, but… I never saw something like that, and I can’t just made up a story for you. This could actually be the discovery of a new specie!”

Lucy, smiled, she didn’t need to see James as an omniscient man, his honesty and excitement about the little creature made her even more in love. “Pleas, James, don’t add anything more! You’re an amazing man, I’m impressed by your transparency and passion for your work, let’s find out what it is!”

James was surprise and relieved by her reply, and now the focus was all on the little bird. It was around 10 cm tall, eating leafs of big fig tree. The couple start to silently taking pictures and taking notes of all the details. “Why are you drawing it if you just photographed it?”, said her, “Habit, I know you’re the artist here, but it’s easy to add arrows and details on its behaviour. I don’t understand, it’s really acting like the Violacea Frutifera Passera but the all the colours are different, it doesn’t make sense!”, he said thinking aloud. “Like what?! James, speak in English… ”, “Ah, right, do you remember the little purple bird we saw close to the lake three days ago where you draw the turtle?”, “Yes! I loved that place, it seems magical, let’s go back there today, please!”

He spend another good half an hour writing notes, drawing details, and time to time explaining all to Lucy. She was getting bored and impatient, it was getting late and if they were not start walking toward the lake now they will miss the sunset. “James, come on! You keep saying it’s exactly like the Violacea Fruttuosa Passera, the purple bird of the lake, maybe it’s just the same with different colours, let’s go to the lake now!!!”
James was keep taking time, but she was right, he was running in a circle and keep ending up on the same conclusion, plus it could be helpful to get back to the lake and observing again the ‘purple bird’. “OK, let’s go to the lake”, said him with a hint of irritation. 

The two of them didn’t speak for all the way to the lake, Lucy was getting better and better in orienting herself in the forest and was leading the way. Then they got into a little fight thinking they were lost, when all of a sudden the magical place appeared. Red, pink and purple lights from the sunset were reflected on the surface of the lake. It was a stunning view. The couple walked slowly together passing by the last trees between them and the water, he took her hand and all the tensions disappeared. She took her clothes off and enter in the lake, he did the same, keeping and open eye to the surroundings looking for the Violacea Frutifera Passera they saw few days ago.

The atmosphere was out of time, the sound of the water moved by the bodies, the smell of the flowers, all the senses where engaged in this romantic moment. Lucy was feeling all the love for him, she looked into his eyes and noticed he was still looking for the ‘purple bird’. “James! I can’t believe you can’t stay in the moment, where’s your mind right now?”. They started another discussion, she was going to go out from the lake, then she stopped and her jaw dropped in silence. James was surprised “What? What did I say now? I said ‘sorry’, come on Lucy, I’m all here now” Lucy pointed a fingers to a side of the lake “Look James, I’m sure it’s the same turtle we saw the other day, I drew it, I can recognised all the details, look at its colours… “ James was start complaining that she’s wasn’t in the romantic moment too when he saw the turtle. It was the same turtle, but the colours where exactly the ones of the ‘purple bird’, the Violacea Fruttuosa Passera, the same precise pattern of the bird they saw close to that lake was on the left side of the turtle, that was now slowly walking away.


## PART 2

James and Lucy looked into each other eyes in silence, she was behind him, he took her hand and slowly started moving towards the purple turtle, naked they crossed the river without thinking if anyone will pass by the forest.

The turtle entered the jungle, “James, we’re naked!”, “Shhh, just few more steps and we’re going back”, “The turtle is not that fast I’ll take the clothes and go back to you in no time, it’s getting dark, I don’t want to loose my clothes”, “OK, Lucy, take everything then” 
Lucy left Jame’s hand and go back to the beach to wear her clothes and collect everything before loosing them.

“Here, James, wear your stuff, I’ll keep an eye on the turtle”, he dressed up and then took the backpack from Lucy shoulders, “Oh, no! You distracted me I lost the turtle!”, “What do you mean you lost the turtle?!”, “It was there, it was hiding in that direction, it can’t be far”. 

It was was really getting dark at this point, they’re started thinking it will be quite impossible to follow the turtle in the night. They were going to give up and go back home, it was getting cold too, when all of a sudden, a familiar sound. Fiuuuuuiù, Fiuuuuuiù, it was the sound of the purple/turtle bird! “Did you hear that Lucy? Did you here it?” , “Was it the purple, emh, turtle bird?”, “Yes! Let’s keep walking in that direction!”

“Oh, wait, there’s someone, let’s hide in there, Lucy!”, “Why? We’re chasing a turtle and a bird, what’s the problem if they see us?”, “Just, shut up and hide. I didn’t hear them arrive, it's weird”, “Maybe your super sense of hearing was too focused on the bird sounds!“. James put his hand on Lucy’s mouth and pull her behind a bush. Two men arrived and started talking.

“I told you switching caps is not a good idea!”, “Yeah, well, the forest didn’t seem to get crazy for that, the texture of your cap is better than mine”, “Just give me mine, let’s avoid getting in trouble in here!”, “I just want to remind you I’m doing all this for you brother, you brought me in this mess, we can’t sort of disappearing for ever, we need to find a solution quickly”, “I know, I know, Thomas. I know, but she still don’t know that we are two distinct person, we are the victims of our own game!”

“You know, Bruce, there’s a nice and smooth way to solve all this. I could just take your woman and run away, keep her focus on the turtle on the day, explaining I’m a busy business man, and spent ecstatic moments during the nights.” 
“What?!” said Bruce jumping on his brother, “Calm down, I’m kidding! Even it’s tempting I'll never do that, plus I'm finally having some relax time exploring the world as a turtle, but I definitely don’t want to stay this way for ever!”

Lucy and James were still hidden behind the bushes, their eyes where wide opened and their jaws dropped several times. They couldn’t believe what they heard. Was it a joke? Were they dreaming? They stayed still and very closed all the time without saying a word. They felt each other astonishment and, to avoid any sound, they never turn to see the reaction in the face of the other.

The two brothers started making plans on how to reach the house of a certain wise old woman and finally moved from there.

“James, let’s follow them, do you believe that… “, “I… How is that possible? What… What happened?” "Could it really be real?"
